                    <p style="padding: 30px 20px 30px 20px;">The Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra is proving to be a breath-taking example of Samsung’s latest innovations at work. Raising the bar for smartphone innovation, its revolutionary camera capabilities also rose to the challenge of harsh outdoor
                        lighting – in the hands of GQ’s trendsetting editorial team and acclaimed photographer, Austin Malema. In GQ’s May/June issue Samsung’s most intelligent camera was used to create dynamic dual covers that capture the imagination,
                        as well as the star power of Springbok star Makazole Mapimpi. With its technology theme in mind, the GQ team effortlessly demonstrated how the pro-grade camera and comprehensive suite of in-camera editing tools can deliver a DSLR-like
                        experience. Named as a device that breaks the rules of light and even space, for GQ, collaborating with Samsung and its headline-grabbing Galaxy S22 Ultra was a seamless editorial decision. It was a showcase for how smartphone
                        photography has taken an evolutionary step forward.</p>
